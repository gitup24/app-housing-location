class:
date from API, or define events for ex. (model)
template :
define ui for the component (view)
style :
CSS, SAS, LESS. Scoped to our component
1:32 Hearder. We don t need to make as a component. We add it to the app cpnt template
1 :48 Case ao search box and search result. Tey are together so we kee them in thier own  cpnt called HomeComponent
They can be nested and used inside another
2:02 Photo and location can create a cpnt.
Style and structure will be the same bute the data different. And will use it IN Home cpnt
3:20 style:
ng generate component home --standalone --inline-template
--standalone reduce complexity and cool features
--inline-template less files to manage
4:40 rererence the new cpnt in the template. Section a a link to the header element with a class content as a child of the section element.
4:51 Add section with a class "content". Lets add our cpnt Wapp-homeX
5:29 the import tell de dependencies for the child cpnt
5:57 set a value array to the import
6:30 mark up in Home cpnt for the search bar and result. Add a section elt with a form as a child.
And a button with a type attribute set to button
Another section that ahe the class result. Add the housing location to the result section
Before let s create a cpnt for it. And we have to import it and add it as a depedency of the Home cpnt
6:40 add a form as a title <form>. It has no 2 children
7:30 ng generate component HousingLocation --standalone --inline-template
8:010 add dependency of the home cpnt
8:04 add a file of import for HousingLocation cpnt
Add a file of import for HousingLocation cpnt . But automaticaly after updating decorator array*/
8:32 add the tag in the section of the template of the same file. Confirmation en cascade avec l'affichage txt "...works!"
For now we have only this txt in the result section. Add <app-housing-location>
4
0:30 add a section elt with the class "listing"
next , add 3 type elts. image tag with the class "listing-photo". header tag with class "listing-heading". paragraph tag with the class "listing-location"
1:30 now the HTML does not have any content. Need a special property that mahe housing location unique. Fortubatly we have the feature 'input properties'
How should that data be configured? In a specific form. It is a job for a type. We create an interface to use in our app.
3:16 ng generate interface housingLocation
4:07 we use input data property tu pass our data to our cpnt and use an interface to let our cpnt what type of data we expect.
You can mark up a cpnr with an input decorator and this tell to angular what king od data can be send in our template.
